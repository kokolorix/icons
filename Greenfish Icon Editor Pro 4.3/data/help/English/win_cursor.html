<h1>Windows cursors</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Windows cursors are similar to <a href="win_icon.html">icons</a> in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>They can contain multiple small images called <a href="basic.html#pages">pages</a> depicting the same thing, differing in size and/or color depth.</li>
<li>The <em>.cur</em> file format is almost the same as <em>.ico</em>, with some minor differences.</li>
</ul>

<p>But cursors also differ from icons in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>They only have a few pages. <em>32x32</em> is required, <em>48x48</em> and <em>64x64</em> (for high-resolution screens) are optional.</li>
<li>These pages come in only one color depth that is usually 1-bit or 32-bit.</li>
<li>Each page has a <em>hot spot</em>, which is a special pixel where the clicking occurs. This can be set with the <a href="tool.html#HOT_SPOT"><em><span data-tool-icon="HOT_SPOT"></span> Hot spot (H)</em> tool</a>.
</li>
<li>A special "color" called <em><span data-misc-glyph="INVERTED"></span> inverted</em> is supported. This allows the pointer to be visible over almost any background. Inverted parts will look black over a white background, and white over a black background. You can select the inverted color for drawing with the <span data-misc-glyph="INVERTED"></span> button in the color picker panel:</li>

<li>Cursors can be animated but then they have to be saved in <em>.ani</em> file format.</li>
</ul>

<p>For some examples, look at <em>C:\Windows\Cursors</em>. Load and examine them in Greenfish Icon Editor Pro.</p>

<h2>Testing your cursor</h2>

<p>Follow the steps described <a href="win_icon.html#test">here</a>, i.e. press <em>Ctrl+Shift+T</em> to open the <em>Test</em> window.</p>

<p>You can also draw on the test background with your cursor:</p>

<h2>Animated cursors</h2>

<ul>
<li>Static cursors are stored in <em>.cur</em> files. Animated cursors are stored in <em>.ani</em> files.</li>
<li>Each page of an animated cursor has more than one <a href="basic.html#frames">frames</a>.</li>
<li>Each frame has a <em>duration</em> which has a resolution of 1/60 seconds in the <em>.ani</em> file.</li>
<li>Different frames can have different hot spots. By default, the <a href="tool.html#HOT_SPOT"><em><span data-tool-icon="HOT_SPOT"></span> Hot spot (H)</em> tool</a> sets the same hot spot for all frames of the current page. However, a separate hot spot can be set for the current frame by pressing <em>Ctrl</em> while using the tool.</li>
<li>The duration can be set by choosing the menu item <em>Frames | Frame properties</em> or by double-clicking the frame thumbnail in the frame list below the editor.</li>
<ul>
  <li>You can use any value but, for optimum results, use a multiple of 1000/60 milliseconds (fractions and even more complex formulae are understood by Greenfish Icon Editor Pro).</li>
</ul>

<li><em>Important:</em> if there are more than one pages, then each page must have:</li>
<ul>
  <li>the same number of frames, and</li>
  <li>any two corresponding frames must have the same duration (e.g. frame #23 of page #1, and frame #23 of page #2).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
